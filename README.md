# healthyHabits
Habits Tracker

## Concept
We wanted a way to track goals or habits that are not just fitness related
  Examples: reading, learn a language, save money


## Function
Add goal/habit and track progress over time

## Process
Breakdown of tasks and roles: 
Brianne: Goals pages, resources, components
Brooke: Auth, models, components
Juan: Progress page, components
Josh: Water reminder
Challenges: Goals page working outside project, but not inside. Auth. Connecting pieces and having pages/components play well together.
Process: Help from TAâ€™s, tutors, askBCS, google


## Directions for future Development
Goals page working
Auth working for everyone
A way to check-in/track goal progress
See progress when Goals are working
Fix BMI calculator, add water reminder
